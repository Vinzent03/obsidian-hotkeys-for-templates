# Hotkeys for templates

Plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

## How to use
This plugin lists all of your template files in its settings pane. You have to enable the template files, which you want a command for. Then you can set a hotkey for the command through the default "Hotkeys" section in the settings. Just search for "Hotkeys for templates".

**Important:** You have to enable and set a template folder in the core template plugin settings. Search for it in the help vault if you don't know the core plugin.

**Supported templates:** 
- Templates from the core templates plugin
- Templates from the [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) plugin
